# description
This project is a qt6 based disk management tool published for b-tree filesystem management and configuration. The main application source used in the tool is based on btrfs-progs. I am just providing the necessary interface and iso structure for easier and more portable disk management.
# setup
You can compile the source code structure for the installation, but instead you can install it by burning the ready iso image to USB. You can use the ready iso source structure for disk data recovery or other disk management tasks.

The copyrights of this software belong to Azcosf Azencompiler Open Source Foundation and to me goychay23.
